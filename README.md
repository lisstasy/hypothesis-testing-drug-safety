# Hypothesis Testing in Healthcare: Drug Safety

## Overview

GlobalXYZ, a pharmaceutical company, has recently completed a randomized controlled drug trial. The objective of this project is to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the drug's outcomes. The provided dataset, `drug_safety.csv`, includes information on adverse effects, demographic data, vital signs, and more. The dataset, obtained from [Hbiostat](https://hbiostat.org/data/) courtesy of the Vanderbilt University Department of Biostatistics, features five adverse effects: headache, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, upper respiratory infection, and chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD). Notably, the ratio of drug observations to placebo observations is 2 to 1.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are to identify the adverse reactions associated with the drug and assess whether these reactions, if present, occur in significant proportions. The dataset has been modified for this analysis, specifically highlighting the presence and absence of adverse effects (`adverse_effects`) and the count of adverse effects in a single individual (`num_effects`).

## Dataset Source

The dataset was sourced from [Hbiostat](https://hbiostat.org/data/) and is made available through the Vanderbilt University Department of Biostatistics.

## Project Structure

- `drug_safety.csv`: The main dataset file.
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis code.

## Data Modification

For the purpose of this project, the dataset has been modified to include additional information on adverse effects.

## Instructions

To reproduce the analysis or contribute to the project, follow the steps outlined in the Jupyter Notebook (`analysis.ipynb`). 

Feel free to explore the dataset and contribute to the enhancement of drug safety analysis.
